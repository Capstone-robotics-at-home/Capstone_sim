# Repo for 3D rendering using gym.MuJoCo 
* Directly used the resouce code and deleted many unused files 
* Ideally, it can be the same using _pip install -e_ as the tuturial notes 
  
# An 'inaccurate' simulation env for jetbot 
* With 3D rendering, the Mojoco_jetbot can move forward, left, right 
* Similar command as Jetbot, even less accurate
* Hopefully, after tested feasible here, the real world jetbot can act as we want.

# MotionRender 
* A 3D render for Jetbot 
* The render can read cmd.txt to decide the motion of Jetbot according to it.
